# ðŸŸ¦ Fair Value Gaps

Zones created by inefficiency in the market & usually occur on a specific zone where there is less trading activity seen and price only has the one directional movement

Zones where a lots of orders were injected for creating the inefficiency in the market

Excellent point of interest when coupled with order blocks

Magnet for price in the future to fill the inefficiency as there are many resting orders

Zones can be used as targets for entries
