# üõç Supply & Demand Zones

## Supply Zone

A zone where big guys sell and there is a big drop

The longer the time the market has spent away from the zone, the stronger the zone becomes

Nearby zones are more powerful than the ones formed a long time ago

## Why Market Returns To Supply And Demand Zones

* Market should return to the supply and demand zone fast. In 1 hour chart within 24 hours of them being created.
* Market return to the zones because the banks were not able to get all of their trades placed when the zone formed.
