# â–¶ Wedge

Wedges are continuation patterns similar to pennants in that they are drawn using two converging trendlines; however, a wedge is characterized by the fact that both trendlines are moving in the same direction, either up or down.

A wedge angled down represents a pause during an uptrend; a wedge angled up shows a temporary interruption during a falling market. As with pennants and flags, volume typically tapers off during pattern formation, only to increase once price breaks above or below the wedge pattern.

Wedges differ from triangles and pennants in that they reflect only upward and downward price movements, so the wedge generally appears angled.
