# ↔ Balanced Price Range

A Balanced Price Range is the result of an aggressive move up that’s immediately followed by an aggressive move down (or an aggressive move down that’s immediately followed by an aggressive move up).&#x20;

What’s left after either of these instances is essentially a double Fair Value Gap which can act as a magnet to the price before a continuation move higher or lower.\

Balanced Price Ranges can sometimes signal the beginning of a Market Structure Shift, and the price can often retest and reject from these areas.
