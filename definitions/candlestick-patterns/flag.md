# üèÅ Flag

Flags are continuation patterns constructed using two parallel trendlines that can slope up, down, or sideways (horizontal). Generally, a flag with an upward slope (bullish) appears as a pause in a down trending market; a flag with a downward bias (bearish) shows a break during an up trending market. Typically, the flag's formation is accompanied by declining volume, which recovers as price breaks out of the flag formation.
