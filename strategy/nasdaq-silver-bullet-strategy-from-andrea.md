# ðŸŽ¯ NASDAQ Silver Bullet Strategy from Andrea

### Rules

1. Don't trade on Monday
2. Don't trade the day of NFP (Non farm payrolls)
3. Mark 9:50 am and 11:45 am on the chart
4. Go to the 1m tf and mark highs and lows
5. Wait for a liquidity sweep
6. Wait for price to make a push back below/above the liquidity
7. Mark up FVG
8. If setup is small, wait for BOS before entering
9. Once price reaches the FVG, take the trade
10. Put stops at the high/low and targets at a reasonable area of liquidity
11. Never target less than a 1:2, and put stops to breakeven at 1:2, if holding
12. You can scale in at additional breaks of liquidity and then retests off the FVG, even though there's no MSS

### Notes

* Adjust to the vol of current price action. This will make price less choppy, and also expose small setups
* When stops are large, only go for a 1:2
* If an AMD (Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution) is present, this can be used as an additional confirmation
* When a really small FVG setup appears, wait for a BOS before looking to enter the setup. BOS and entry from FVG can happen on the same candle, and still be valid. Example of when not to enter.

* When price creates a BOS and then comes back and touches the FVG, even without a clear move up/down first, it is still valid
* Most liquidity grab setups will present entries off of FVGs, not OBs
* Don't take trades off of very thin and small FVGs. They are low probability.
* When FVG is too close to the liquidity sweep, compared to the high/low of the push afterwards, don't enter.
* Displacement when sweeping liquidity is a sign of the trade being higher probability. Displacement is when price has heavy volume when creating a BOS
* If there is more than one FVG, draw a fib and enter off of the nearest FVG if price touches the 50%
