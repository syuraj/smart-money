# âš– Imbalance

Imbalances are when there is more buying or selling pressure in one direction than the other. ICT Concepts traders believe that imbalances can be a sign that institutional traders are accumulating or distributing an asset.

In the diagram below, vol. imbalance is shown as a gap where only wicks are connected but not body. Price always comes back to fill the gap.
