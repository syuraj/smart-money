# ðŸ§§ Displacement

A very powerful move in price action resulting in strong selling or buying pressure.&#x20;

Generally speaking, displacement will appear as a single or a group of candles that are all positioned in the same direction.&#x20;

These candles typically have large real bodies and very short wicks, suggesting a very little disagreement between buyers and sellers.
