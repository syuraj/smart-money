It is the key step.

I don't use very large zones and try to see if the zone has been hit multiple times in the past.

The zone should be followed by 3 bull or bear candles as shown in the picture above

### Step 2: Switch to lower timeframe (3 or 5 min) and Wait for Price to come to one of the zones marked

### Step 3: Entry after MACD histogram divergence in 3/5 min timeframe

Macd divergence gives the best entry as shows signal before the move.

Macd divergence signal may not be reliable on trending days.

Use 50 period EMA for additional confirmation of bias.

Stop loss should be below the zone.

For Options, delta > 0.5 and theta < 0.4 as a general guidelines.
