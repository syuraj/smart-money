# â“‚ Double Top & Bottom

## Double Top

The double top or bottom are reversal patterns, signaling areas where the market has made two unsuccessful attempts to break through a support or resistance level.

A [double top](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doubletop.asp) often looks like the letter M and is an initial push up to a resistance level followed by a second failed attempt, resulting in a trend reversal.

## Double Bottom

A [double bottom](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublebottom.asp), on the other hand, looks like the letter W and occurs when the price tries to push through a support level, is denied, and makes a second unsuccessful attempt to breach the support level. This often results in a trend reversal, as shown in the figure below.
