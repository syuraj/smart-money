# ðŸ§˜â™‚ Mantra

* Charting in 15 min timeframe or higher. 1 min timeframe for entries only.
* Need 3 reasons for entry. (e.g break of a downtrend, supply zone, golden cross).
* Only limit orders, NO FOMO.
* Always TP (take profit) and SL (stop loss), no exceptions.
* No more than 20% loss in a single trade.
* R/R ratio (Reward to Risk) should be at least 1.5:1.
* Donâ€™t convert day trade into swing trade.
* If you lose because you donâ€™t follow your own rules, punch a wall as your own punishment.
* If you lose 3 times in a row, youâ€™re done for the day.
