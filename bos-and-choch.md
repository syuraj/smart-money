# ðŸ”º BOS & CHoCH

## Break of Structure (BOS)

Break of Structure is the continuation of the trend.

In uptrend, if it breaks above Higher High (HH), it is BOS. (pic below)

A wick can also create BOS unlike CHoCH

## Change of character (CHoCH) or Market Structure Shift (MSS)

Change of character is the reversal of the trend.

In uptrend, if it breaks below Higher Low (HL), it is CHoCH. (pic below)

CHoCH needs the body to be below HL to be valid
