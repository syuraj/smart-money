# ▶ Pennant

Pennants are continuation patterns drawn with two trendlines that eventually converge. A key characteristic of pennants is that the trendlines move in two directions—one will be a down trendline and the other an up trendline.&#x20;

Often, the volume will decrease during the formation of the pennant, followed by an increase when the price eventually breaks out.
