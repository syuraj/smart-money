### Step 1: Mark Supply & Demand Zone in 15 min timeframe

It is the key step.

I don't use very large zones and try to see if the zone has been hit multiple times in the past.

The zone should be followed by 3 bull or bear candles as shown in the picture above

### Step 2: Switch to lower timeframe (3 or 5 min) and Wait for Price to come to one of the zones marked

### Step 3: Watch for MACD histogram divergence in 3/5 min timeframe

Macd divergence gives the best entry as shows signal before the move.

Macd divergence signal may not be reliable on trending days.
